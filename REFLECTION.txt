	This project was super interesting to partake in. "A simple calculator" seemed easy and straightforward enough to do, we thought this wouldn't take any time at all. After we started planning it out and and creating the necessary algorithms, me (Omar) and my partner (Ganna) suddenly became unsure of how to approach this project and what exactly we should do. Such a simple problem required so much planning and such high levels of data validation and logic implementation. Not to mention the problems we had in setting git up in itself! I think the most important  thing this project taught me is how to use resources to our advantage, and to reflect and realize that the age of the internet is truly one of the most remarkable times in the history of mankind. Originally we had no idea what the shunting yard algorithm was, but we were able to learn and implement it successfully as well as trouble shoot and debug the complex logic behind it. Moreover, a really valuable lesson I learned was the value of having a partner who knows what you're doing and how you're going about implementing your ideas. It was such a wonderful experience to have Ganna by my side while developing this project and to have her mind approaching the problem from different angles. Teamwork makes the dream work!
